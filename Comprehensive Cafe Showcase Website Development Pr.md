# Comprehensive Cafe Showcase Website Development Prompt

## Overview

Create a highly engaging, one-page cafe showcase website for a portfolio project that immerses users in a virtual coffee shop experience. The site must highlight a curated selection of coffees, pastries, cookies, and other edible items, with interactive elements allowing users to click on each product for detailed views including price, ingredients, coffee type (if applicable), taste profile, calorie count, and energy benefits (e.g., caffeine boost or nutritional value). Ensure all elements are visible and accessible through smooth navigation. Use state-of-the-art UI/UX principles to deliver a minimalistic, aesthetic, and authentic design that feels handcrafted and useful, prioritizing user delight and ease of exploration.

The website will be built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a single index.html file divided into multiple semantic sections (e.g., hero, menu showcase, about, contact). Incorporate one main CSS file for styling and one main JS file for interactivity and effects. Leverage Three.js for 3D elements, GSAP for animations, and other lightweight libraries as needed for visual effects. Draw from 2025 best practices for cafe websites: mobile-first responsive design, high-quality imagery, fast loading (under 2 seconds), SEO optimization (semantic HTML, alt tags, meta descriptions), accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA compliance with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation), and interactive features like parallax scrolling and reveal effects to mimic a cozy cafe ambiance.

## Technical Architecture

### File Structure \& Organization

Use this minimal structure for robustness and ease of maintenance:

```
cafe-showcase/
├── index.html          // Single HTML file with multiple sections
├── styles.css          // Single CSS file for all styling
├── script.js           // Single JS file for all interactivity
├── assets/
│   ├── images/         // High-quality photos of coffees, pastries, etc.
│   ├── models/         // GLTF models for 3D elements (e.g., coffee beans, cups)
│   └── data/           // menu-data.json for product details
└── vendors/            // External libraries: three.min.js, gsap.min.js
```


### Core Technologies

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure with sections like <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer> for accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3:** Flexbox/Grid for layouts, CSS animations for subtle effects, custom properties for theming.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Vanilla JS for core logic; integrate Three.js for 3D coffee bean animations and GSAP for scroll-triggered reveals/parallax.
- **Libraries:** Three.js (for 3D models like floating coffee beans or interactive cups), GSAP (with ScrollTrigger for crazy scroll animations), and no more than two additional lightweight libs (e.g., Anime.js for microinteractions if needed). Avoid heavy frameworks to keep it minimal and performant.


## Design Philosophy \& Principles

### Core UI/UX Design Principles

Adopt a mobile-first, progressive enhancement approach based on 2025 best practices:

- **Minimalism \& Clarity:** Use whitespace generously (8-16px grid system) to avoid clutter; focus on one key element per section for cognitive ease.
- **Authenticity \& Handcrafted Feel:** Incorporate subtle imperfections like organic shapes or handwritten-style fonts to evoke a artisanal cafe vibe.
- **Interactivity \& Immersion:** Every click reveals details with smooth transitions; use parallax and 3D for depth without overwhelming users.
- **Accessibility \& Inclusivity:** Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratios, screen-reader friendly (ARIA attributes), reduced motion options via prefers-reduced-motion query.
- **Performance Optimization:** Lazy-load images, optimize assets (WebP format, <100KB per image), aim for Lighthouse scores >95.
- **SEO Best Practices:** Include meta tags, schema markup for local business (e.g., cafe location, menu items), and fast-loading for better search rankings.


### Color Palette \& Visual Theme

Use vibrant yet earthy tones for an attractive, minimal feel that evokes coffee warmth and nature:

- **Primary:** Warm Terracotta (\#C9744E) for accents/CTAs; Rich Espresso Brown (\#4A2E1B) for text/headings.
- **Secondary:** Vibrant Sage Green (\#8FAE7E) for highlights; Soft Cream (\#F5EBDC) for backgrounds.
- **Supporting:** Muted Gold (\#D4A373) for interactive elements; Deep Charcoal (\#333333) for subtle contrasts.
Apply colors sparingly for minimalism—e.g., earthy gradients on sections, vibrant pops on product hovers.


## Homepage Structure \& Content Showcase

Design as a single-page site with multiple scrollable sections in index.html. The first view (above the fold) is a hero section with a parallax background of steaming coffee, 3D floating beans, and a bold tagline like "Discover Artisan Brews \& Treats." As users scroll, trigger crazy animations: coffee reveal effects (e.g., beans "pouring" into view), scroll-triggered parallax (layers of cafe elements shifting), and 3D rotations (e.g., cups spinning to show details).

### Section Breakdown with Unique Designs

Each section must have a handcrafted, authentic look—vary layouts, fonts, and effects for uniqueness while maintaining minimalism:

- **Hero Section:** Full-viewport with Three.js 3D coffee cup model (rotatable on hover); parallax steam rising; CTA to "Explore Menu."
- **Menu Showcase Section:** Grid of clickable cards for 10-15 products (5 coffees, 5 pastries, 5 others). Each card: image, name, price. On click, modal with details (ingredients, taste notes like "bold, nutty with chocolate undertones," calories, energy e.g., "150mg caffeine for sustained focus"). Use GSAP for reveal animations (cards fade in on scroll).
- **About Section:** Narrative text on cafe's story; 3D parallax background of coffee farm; minimal timeline of "From Bean to Brew."
- **Nutritional \& Details Section:** Integrated into modals; list view with icons for calories/energy.
- **Contact/Footer Section:** Map embed, social links; subtle animation of coffee mug filling on load.


### Animations \& Visual Effects

Incorporate crazy, coffee-themed animations for engagement:

- **Scroll Effects:** GSAP ScrollTrigger for parallax (background layers move at different speeds); reveal effects (products "brew" into view with steam particles).
- **3D Elements:** Three.js for interactive 3D models—e.g., hovering coffee beans that scatter on scroll; rotatable pastry displays.
- **Microinteractions:** Anime.js for hovers (cards lift with glow); loading as coffee pouring animation.
- **Transitions:** Smooth 0.3s ease-ins for modals; crazy effects like bean explosions on section enters.


## Core Features \& Functionality

### Interactive Menu System

Fetch product data from menu-data.json in script.js. Example card:

```html
<section id="menu">
  <div class="product-card" data-id="espresso">
    <img src="assets/images/espresso.jpg" alt="Espresso" loading="lazy">
    <h3>Espresso</h3>
    <p>$3.00</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

On click, JS opens modal with details.

### Product Detail Modals

Comprehensive info: price, ingredients list, taste description, calories, energy (e.g., "Boosts alertness with 64mg caffeine"). Use Three.js for 3D ingredient visualizations.

### Responsive Design

Breakpoints: Mobile (320px+), Tablet (768px+), Desktop (1024px+). Use media queries in styles.css for adaptive grids.

## Data Architecture

menu-data.json example:

```json
[
  {"id": "espresso", "name": "Espresso", "price": 3.00, "ingredients": ["Arabica beans", "Water"], "taste": "Bold, intense", "calories": 2, "energy": "64mg caffeine"}
]
```


## Development Guidelines

- **Best Practices Integration:** From research—include high-res images (professional photography), fast load (compress assets), social proof (mock testimonials), and cafe-specific elements like virtual tours via 3D.
- **Testing:** Cross-browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), device testing, accessibility audits.
- **Phases:** 1. Structure HTML sections. 2. Style with CSS. 3. Add JS interactivity and effects.

This prompt ensures a robust, aesthetic portfolio piece that demonstrates advanced web skills while adhering to cafe website best practices.
